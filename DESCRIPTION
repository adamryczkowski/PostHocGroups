Description: Takes function fn(item1, item2, ...) -> {0, 1} (different, not-
    different) that returns whether specific items are statistically different (or
    just the simmilarity matrix) and returns approximate view of the matrix as a set
    of mutually exclusive subsets, each statistically different from the other.
